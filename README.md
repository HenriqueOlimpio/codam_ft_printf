# Ft_printf
The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf().
You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments. How cool is that??
It is actually pretty cool :)

I implemented the following conversions:
‚Ä¢ %c Prints a single character.
‚Ä¢ %s Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
‚Ä¢ %p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.
‚Ä¢ %d Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
‚Ä¢ %i Prints an integer in base 10.
‚Ä¢ %u Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
‚Ä¢ %x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
‚Ä¢ %X Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.
‚Ä¢ %% Prints a percent sign.
# üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Requirements

The library is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the library**

To compile the library, run:

```shell
$ cd path/to/ft_printf && make
```

**2. Using it in your code**

To use the library functions in your code, simply include its header:

```C
#include "ft_printf.h"
```

and, when compiling your code, add the required flags:

```shell
-lftprintf -L path/to/libftprintf.a -I path/to/ft_printf.h
```

## üìã Testing

**1. Configuring**

First, open the [`Makefile`](testing/Makefile) inside `/testing/` and configure the path to the `ft_printf` folder:

```Makefile
PROJECT_DIR	= ../ft_printf/
```

Then, configure the tests to your needs in the [`/testing/main.c`](testing/main.c) file.

**2. Running:**

```shell
make
```
